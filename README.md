## About The Project

Pastel Shadows is an open-source game development project aiming to create a fun and engaging experience. The core philosophy is to build the engine and game primarily from scratch using C++ and the Vulkan graphics API, keeping external dependencies to an absolute minimum. This project serves as both a learning experience and a foundation for a potentially fully-featured game.

### NOTE: Proper README file comming scoon!
